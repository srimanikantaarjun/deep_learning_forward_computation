# Deep_Learning_Forward_Computation
Files are part of my coursework from the course DSCI 6671 Deep Learning

The files are part of 1st assignment of Deep Learning course.

Here, we compute the forward computation of a simple Neural Network - Multi-layer Perceptron.

We do this using mathematical concepts like, matrix, vectors, derivatives of forward computation functions.

The concepts covered would be:

  Activation Functions:
      Rectified Linear Unit
      Softmax function
  
  Loss:
    Cross-Entropy Loss
  
  One - hot Encoding
  
  Evaluation metrics:
    Accuracy
    Squared Mean Absolute Error(optional, would suggest you to give it a try)
